        Hello Kitty (Japanese: ハロー・キティ, Hepburn: Harō Kiti),[6] also
        known by her real name Kitty White (キティ・ホワイト, Kiti Howaito),[5]
        is a fictional character created by Yuko Shimizu, currently designed by
        Yuko Yamaguchi, and owned by the Japanese company Sanrio.[7][8][9]
        Sanrio depicts Hello Kitty as an anthropomorphized white cat with a red
        bow and no visible mouth.[10][11] According to her backstory, she lives
        in a London suburb with her family, and is close to her twin sister
        Mimmy, who is depicted with a yellow bow.[5][12] Hello Kitty was created
        in 1974 and the first item, a vinyl coin purse, was introduced in
        1975.[13][14] Originally Hello Kitty was only marketed towards
        pre-teenage girls, but beginning in the 1990s, the brand found
        commercial success among teenage and adult consumers as well.[15] Hello
        Kitty's popularity also grew with the emergence of kawaii (cute)
        culture.[16] The brand went into decline in Japan after the 1990s, but
        continued to grow in the international market.[17] By 2010 the character
        was worth $5 billion a year and The New York Times called her a "global
        marketing phenomenon".[17] By 2014, when Hello Kitty was 40 years old,
        she was worth about $8 billion a year.[18] UNICEF has appointed Hello
        Kitty children's ambassador and the Japanese government appointed her
        ambassador of tourism.[15] There are Sanrio theme parks based on Hello
        Kitty: Harmonyland in Hiji, Ōita, Japan,[19] Sanrio Puroland in Tama New
        Town, Tokyo, Japan, and Hello Kitty Shanghai Times in Shanghai,
        China.[20] The Hello Kitty media franchise has grown to include a number
        of animated series targeted towards children, as well as several comics,
        animated films, video games, books, music albums and other media
        productions. A variety of products have featured the character over the
        years, like school supplies, clothing, accessories and toys, along with
        other items. As of 2008 there were over 50,000 different Hello Kitty
        branded products.
